# Helium

Helium is a one-stop shop for developing, building and deploying a Kubernetes application
to development, staging and production environments.

This tool is very opinionated, and provides sensible defaults for building your applications.
It does, however, allow you to opt-out of the defaults as your application gets more complex.
