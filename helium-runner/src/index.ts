/**
 * The Brigade Worker is responsible for executing `brigade.js` files.
 *
 * When the Brigade Worker starts, it will look for the following environment
 * variables, which it will use to generate BrigadeEvent and Project configuration:
 *
 * - `BRIGADE_EVENT_TYPE`: The event type, such as `push`, `pull_request`
 * - `BRIGADE_EVENT_PROVIDER`: The name of the event provider, such as `github` or `dockerhub`
 * - `BRIGADE_PROJECT_ID`: The project ID. This is used to load the Project
 *   object from configuration.
 * - `BRIGADE_COMMIT`: The VCS commit ID (e.g. the Git commit)
 * - `BRIGADE_PAYLOAD`: The payload from the original event trigger.
 * - `BRIGADE_PROJECT_NAMESPACE`: For Kubernetes, this is the Kubernetes namespace in
 *   which new jobs should be created. The Brigade worker must have write access to
 *   this namespace.
 * - `BRIGADE_BUILD`: The ULID for the build. This is unique.
 * - `BRIGADE_BUILD_NAME`: This is actually the ID of the worker.
 *
 * Also, the Brigade script must be written to `brigade.js`.
