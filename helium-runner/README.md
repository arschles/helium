# Helium Runner

This directory contains a Typescript program that is able to run & interpret helium JS
files.

The code herein is intended to be run in a Docker image (i.e. as a CircleCI job, as a Kubernetes pod, etc...) or locally in your build env.

# Credits

Almost all of the code, and the idea for this component, is taken from the wonderful
[Brigade-Worker](https://github.com/Azure/brigade/blob/master/brigade-worker) project.
